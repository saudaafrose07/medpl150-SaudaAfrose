<p>Reading: "In Plato's Cave" by Susan Sontag</p>
<p>9/11/2025</p>
<p>Photography for me is capturing and solidifying important moments into memories. We go through many moments in our lives, but sometimes those experiences become forgotten. Whether it be Eid day, a day out with my friends, or a dinner with my family, photography remains as proof that I’ve experienced that specific moment before. I also see photography as a way to preserve culture, history and family relationships. This point is also mentioned by author Susan Sontag of the reading, In Plato’s Cave, where she says “Through photographs, each family constructs a portrait-chronicle of itself-a portable kit of images that bears witness to its connectedness” (Sontag 8). I come from an immigrant family, and I came to the United States when I was only 4. Due to this, I don’t have many memories of my life in my home country, Bangladesh. My parents packed up their lives in Bangladesh into many suitcases and dozens of albums. Whenever I go through those albums today, I get a glimpse of my parents’ and my life in Bangladesh. I am also introduced to my family history, different Bengali cultures, and traditions. Like the author states “A family's photograph album is generally about the extended family-and, often, is all that remains of it” (Sontag 9). The photographs I have now, are the only remains of my life and experiences back in Bangladesh.  Since I don’t live in Bangladesh, I can’t bring the country with me, so whenever I visit, I carry snapshots of my time in that country to revisit the experience whenever I want to.</p>
<br>
<p>In addition, photographs not only preserve memory, but they have also preserved the connections to my culture. In my opinion, today’s society lacks a unique culture. Everyone is just running aimlessly to be the same, to follow a materialistic, fast paced life. In doing this, they forget their own culture and history. I would use photography to remind people of the different cultures and backgrounds in this world.  I would capture those small, slow moments in everyday life that set us apart from each other. For example, I might capture the Bengali tradition of mothers putting henna on their daughter’s hair as a hair mask. Or I might capture the South Korean culture of eating miyeok-guk (seaweed soup) on birthdays. These little things may seem insignificant at first, but they ground us and bring us back to our roots. However, one thing Sontag mentions is that photographs may hinder our ability to experience a moment or see the rawness of a moment “by limiting experience to a search for the photogenic, by converting experience into an image, a souvenir” (Sontag 9). Although this might hold true sometimes, since photographers can photograph what appeals to them or their biases, photography can also increase our awareness of certain situations and connect us to topics that matter. Like Sontag mentions, photographs remain proof that something happened, which is why people believe in photographs. In the same way, taking pictures of smaller moments can reconnect us to our roots and culture by demonstrating that the culture was once a part of us. When I’m working on future projects, I can use this perspective to approach them by capturing small, candid moments through photography or design, highlighting my values of family and history. All in all, photographs to me are a way to preserve memory, family, and history.</p>

<p>Reading: "With ‘AI slop’ distorting our reality, the world is sleepwalking into disaster by Nesrine Malik</p>
<p>10/15/2025</p>
<p>In the article “With ‘AI slop’ distorting our reality, the world is sleepwalking into disaster,” the author Nesrine Malik from “The Guardian” explains how the increased use of AI, particularly by far-right figures, has made it hard to discern between actual news and fake news. I agree with her points, especially because the world today is so dependent on AI that people are just consuming information to feed their ideologies without taking a step back and asking themselves if what they’re seeing is actually true. Key political figures and social media platforms capitalize on this by creating images and videos that evoke emotions, such as excitement and anger, to promote a specific idea. Some examples of this are the “YouTube videos of made-up scenarios in which Trump officials prevail against liberal forces” (Nesrine). These videos paint Republicans and Trump in a heroic way and indicate that the liberal force is something that needs to be combatted. In reality, both political groups have their own agendas, and forcing these groups to fight against each other just causes more polarization amongst the American public. .</p>
<br>
<p>To add on, this article reminded me of the incident between Chris Cuomo and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, where Cuomo was tricked by a deepfake video of Ocasio-Cortez bashing the Sydney Sweeney American Eagle Ad. The video led to a heated exchange between the two before it was revealed that the whole video was actually a deepfake generated by AI. This incident supports Nesrine’s idea that “ all media consumption, even for the most discerning users, becomes impossible to curate” (Nesrine). Due to the overconsumption of media and political forces shoving their biases into our faces, we find it hard to figure out what to believe and what to ignore. This is a bit similar to how I feel whenever I go to Times Square at night. There are so many lights, noise, and movement everywhere that sometimes I feel overwhelmed and don’t know where to look. Similarly, when I’m on social media, sometimes I like something or feel angry about a post before I realize it is AI-generated. But this inability to differentiate or sort real information from malinformation makes us more vulnerable to extreme opinions and content. </p>
<br>
<p>Also, this leads to problematic content such as “AI-generated images of white, blond families… as models of a desirable future” (Nesrine) and the “‘trad wife’ content” (Nesrine) of “beautiful supplicant homemakers” (Nesrine). Political figures often feed into this content in an attempt to create a society that they deem desirable. However, in order to avoid these mistakes, we as a society need to educate ourselves on news literacy, and we need to be more compassionate towards other people’s opinions. Today, people are so quick to jump to conclusions that they struggle to respectfully converse with someone without disrespecting their perspective. If we learned how to differentiate news from propaganda and if we were a bit more open to understanding other perspectives, then I believe AI’s grip on us might just weaken.</p>
