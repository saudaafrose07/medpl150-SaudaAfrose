<p>Reading: "In Plato's Cave" by Susan Sontag</p>

<p>Photography for me is capturing and solidifying important moments into memories. We go through many moments in our lives, but sometimes those experiences become forgotten. Whether it be Eid day, a day out with my friends, or a dinner with my family, photography remains as proof that I’ve experienced that specific moment before. I also see photography as a way to preserve culture, history and family relationships. This point is also mentioned by author Susan Sontag of the reading, In Plato’s Cave, where she says “Through photographs, each family constructs a portrait-chronicle of itself-a portable kit of images that bears witness to its connectedness” (Sontag 8). I come from an immigrant family, and I came to the United States when I was only 4. Due to this, I don’t have many memories of my life in my home country, Bangladesh. My parents packed up their lives in Bangladesh into many suitcases and dozens of albums. Whenever I go through those albums today, I get a glimpse of my parents’ and my life in Bangladesh. I am also introduced to my family history, different Bengali cultures, and traditions. Like the author states “A family's photograph album is generally about the extended family-and, often, is all that remains of it” (Sontag 9). The photographs I have now, are the only remains of my life and experiences back in Bangladesh.  Since I don’t live in Bangladesh, I can’t bring the country with me, so whenever I visit, I carry snapshots of my time in that country to revisit the experience whenever I want to.</p>

<p>In addition, photographs not only preserve memory, but they have also preserved the connections to my culture. In my opinion, today’s society lacks a unique culture. Everyone is just running aimlessly to be the same, to follow a materialistic, fast paced life. In doing this, they forget their own culture and history. I would use photography to remind people of the different cultures and backgrounds in this world.  I would capture those small, slow moments in everyday life that set us apart from each other. For example, I might capture the Bengali tradition of mothers putting henna on their daughter’s hair as a hair mask. Or I might capture the South Korean culture of eating miyeok-guk (seaweed soup) on birthdays. These little things may seem insignificant at first, but they ground us and bring us back to our roots. However, one thing Sontag mentions is that photographs may hinder our ability to experience a moment or see the rawness of a moment “by limiting experience to a search for the photogenic, by converting experience into an image, a souvenir” (Sontag 9). Although this might hold true sometimes, since photographers can photograph what appeals to them or their biases, photography can also increase our awareness of certain situations and connect us to topics that matter. Like Sontag mentions, photographs remain proof that something happened, which is why people believe in photographs. In the same way, taking pictures of smaller moments can reconnect us to our roots and culture by demonstrating that the culture was once a part of us. When I’m working on future projects, I can use this perspective to approach them by capturing small, candid moments through photography or design, highlighting my values of family and history. All in all, photographs to me are a way to preserve memory, family, and history.</p>
