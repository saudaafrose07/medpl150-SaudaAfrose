    <h1>Homework 6 Image</h1>

    <p>For this assignment, I made an eye using two different shades of blue, a dark navy and a light blue. I made three shapes: an oval, a circle, and a diamond. I wanted to convey the emotion of sadness and stillness through my use of the color blue. I also added snowflakes on the side as one of the line strokes to give it a winter aesthetic. Overall, I aimed for a calm, sad emotion. I wanted to symbolize the cold feeling of snow in bare hands or the quiet after a long, busy week.  </p>
