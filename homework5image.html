    <h1>Homework 5 Image</h1>

    <p>For this assignment, I made lotus flowers on Adobe Illustrator because they are the national flower of Bangladesh. I added it to the collage that represents the divide I feel between my identity in Bangladesh and my identity here. It's a way to showcase the beauty of my two identities while also honoring a part of Bangladesh. </p>
