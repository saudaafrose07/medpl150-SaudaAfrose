    <h1>Homework 7 Image 2</h1>

    <p>This is my image after I edited it. I chose a image with simple but modern shapes and lots of arches. I love arches and I believe they're a very elegant addition to any piece. Through this homework I got to redesign an interior with many arches and to do that I used three colors of a neon green, a warm pink and a cool light blue. I used the shapes and the paintbrush tool on Illustrator to redesign my interior and I added a little design on my door using hexagons. Lastly, I added a gradient in the background combining all contrasting three colors. </p>
